- redesign: make the left square a (p x p) selector for a single chart. 
  selections on the diagonal show histograms.
  off-diagonal selections show scatterplots, or 2-D histograms

- initial dataset:
	- add filtering
	- for histogram, add quartiles, mean, variance
	- for scatterplot, add correlation

- figure out why it breaks on data with spaces

- allow the user to change the number of bins

- allow the user to transform variables
